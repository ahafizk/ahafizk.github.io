<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<p>The course provides an introduction to the field of natural language processing (NLP). The topics
include creating systems that can understand and produce language, for applications such as
information extraction, machine translation, automatic summarization, question-answering, and
interactive dialogue systems. The course covers linguistic (knowledge-based) and statistical
approaches to language processing in the areas of syntax (language structures), semantics (language
meaning), and pragmatics/discourse (the interpretation of language in context). Students will design
and develop programs for analyzing and extracting information from large online corpora.</p>
