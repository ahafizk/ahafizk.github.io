## Introduction
This work is the response to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19). The overall goal of the challenge is to facilitate knowledge extraction from the large CORD-19 dataset of over 51,000 scholarly articles, including over 40,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses.

## Scope Of Our Contribution
As the COVID-19 pandemic is becoming the number one concern in the world, there is an urgent need to learn from published literature about COVID-19 related medical care and its effects. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for clinicians and medical research community to keep up and effectively extract relevant information. This work aims to support medical research community by facilitating the search about medical care and its effect through the literature in the CORD-19 Research Dataset.
