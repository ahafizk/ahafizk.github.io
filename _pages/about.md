I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of <a href="https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/cs/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/" target="_blank">Kennesaw State University (KSU)</a>, where I direct the <a href="https://chatlab.us">Cooperative Human-AI Teaming (CHAT) Lab</a>. My research focuses on human–AI teaming as a framework for developing next-generation AI algorithms that integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge representation, and AI-guided learning. I am especially interested in advancing these methods for embedded settings, healthcare, and other safety-critical domains, where the balance between trust, transparency, privacy, and security is vital for real-world deployment.

Before joining KSU, I was a scientist at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Philips Research North America in Cambridge, MA, where I worked on applied AI solutions for healthcare technologies. I earned my Ph.D. in Information Systems from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET). Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a software engineer in several technology companies in Bangladesh.

## Research Areas:

<!-- My research interest spans a wide range of topics in machine learning, deep learning, transfer learning, and their applications in Mobile, Pervasive Computing, Wearable Computing, Healthcare Sensing and Analytics, and Natural Language processing.  -->

Dr. Abdullah Khan’s research centers on Human–AI Teaming, with a focus on enabling collaborative decision-making between humans and intelligent systems. His work spans Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing complex narratives, and Collaborative Explainable AI (XAI) for building interpretable, trust-enhancing systems. He also advances Knowledge-Enhanced Learning & Reasoning, integrating domain expertise and heterogeneous data for more transparent and adaptive AI. To ensure responsible deployment, Dr. Khan investigates Privacy & Security in AI, particularly for sensitive datasets. These methods are applied to text mining, scientific discovery, healthcare, mental health, and other relevant applications, where reliability, accountability, and human oversight are essential.
