I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/cs/" target="_blank">Computer Science department</a> at <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/" target="_blank">Kennesaw State University</a> (KSU). In addition, I direct the <a href="https://ahafizk.github.io/udm/">Ubiquitous Data Mining (UDM) Lab</a> at Kennesaw State University (KSU). Before joining KSU, I was a scientist in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Philips Research North America, Cambridge, MA. 

I obtained Ph.D. in Information Systems from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and received a BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET). I worked as a software engineer in several software companies in Bangladesh.
