I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/cs/">Computer Science department</a> at <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/">Kennesaw State University</a> (KSU). In addition, I direct the Ubiquitous Data Mining (UDM) Lab at the Kennesaw State University. Before joining KSU, I was a scientist in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Philips Research North America, Cambridge, MA, from January 2019 to August 2021. 

I obtained Ph.D. in Information Systems from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in 2019. During my Ph.D., my research focus was on scalable Human Activity Recognition using wearable sensors. My Ph.D. dissertation entitled <b>"Cross-domain Scalable Human Activity Recognition in Smart Environments."</b> I received a BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering& Technology (BUET) in 2009. I worked as a software engineer in several software companies in Bangladesh.
