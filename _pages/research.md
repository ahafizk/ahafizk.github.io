# Research Areas:


<!-- <p> -->

## 1. Human–AI Teaming 
Human–AI teaming is the central focus of our research, where we design and study ML/AI models and frameworks that enable effective collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence systems. Unlike traditional automation, our research work emphasizes partnership and coordination, ensuring that AI complements human expertise rather than replaces it. Designing algorithms, models, and frameworks that enable collaborative decision-making and coordination between humans and AI systems, strongly emphasizing safety-critical domains such as healthcare, behavioral health, and emergency management. 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Large Language Models (LLMs): Developing and applying domain-specific NLP and LLM solutions for understanding, reasoning, and interaction in sensitive contexts. Applications include text mining, question answering, retrieval augmented generation, behavioral health detection from narratives, social media analysis, and emergency communication.

### Collaborative Explainable AI (XAI): 
Creating interpretable and interactive AI systems that support human understanding, trust, and feedback, ensuring that humans remain in the loop during decision-making in healthcare and safety-critical applications.
Through this research, we aim to create next-generation human–AI teams that combine computational intelligence with human judgment, advancing both theory and practice of collaborative, safe, and responsible AI.

## 2. Knowledge-Enhanced Learning & Reasoning: 
Advancing methods integrating structured, symbolic, and contextual knowledge into AI systems to enable transparent reasoning, adaptive decision-making, and interactive learning. This includes building intelligent models that learn from human feedback, domain expertise, and heterogeneous data sources, improving alignment, adaptability, and reliability.
