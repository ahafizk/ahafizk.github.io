<b>Abstract:</b>

Activity recognition using smartphone has great potential
in many applications like healthcare, obesity management,
abnormal behavior detection, public safety and security etc.
Typical activity detection systems are built on to recognize a
limited set of activities that are present in the training and
testing environments. However, these systems require similar data
distributions, activity sets and sufficient labeled training data
in both training and testing phases. Therefore, inferring new
activities is challenging in practical scenarios where training and
testing environments are volatile, data distributions are diverge
and testing environment has new set of activities with limited
training samples. The shortage of labeled training data samples
also degrades the activity recognition performance. In this work,
we address these challenges by augmenting the Instance based
Transfer Boost algorithm with k-means clustering. We evaluated
our TransAct model with three public datasets - HAR, MHealth
and Daily AndSports and demonstrated that our TransAct model
outperforms traditional activity recognition approaches. Our
experimental results show that our TransAct model achieves :::::::
81 % activity detection accuracy on average.
