<b>Abstract:</b>

Following healthy lifestyle is a key for active living.
Regular exercise, controlled diet and sound sleep play an invisible
role on the wellbeing and independent living of the people. Sleep
being the most durative activities of daily living (ADL) has
a major synergistic influence on peopleâ€™s mental, physical and
cognitive health. Understanding the sleep behavior longitudinally
and its underpinning clausal relationships with physiological
signals and contexts (such as eye or body movement etc.) horizontally
responsible for a sound or disruptive sleep pattern help
provide meaningful information for promoting healthy lifestyle
and designing appropriate intervention strategy. In this paper
we propose to detect the microscopic states of the sleep which
fundamentally constitute the components of a good or bad
sleeping behavior and help shape the formative assessment of
sleep quality. We initially investigate several classification techniques
to identify and correlate the relationship of microscopic
sleep states with the overall sleep behavior. Subsequently we
propose an online algorithm based on change point detection to
better process and classify the microscopic sleep states and then
test a lightweight version of this algorithm for real time sleep
monitoring activity recognition and assessment at scale. For a
larger deployment of our proposed model across a community of
individuals we propose an active learning based methodology by
reducing the effort of ground truth data collection. We evaluate
the performance of our proposed algorithms on real data traces,
and demonstrate the efficacy of our models for detecting and
assessing fine-grained sleep states beyond an individual.
