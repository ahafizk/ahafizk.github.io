<b>Abstract:</b>

 Disease named entity recognition (NER) is an important
enabling technology to develop various downstream biomedical
natural language processing applications. This is a challenging task,
which requires addressing potential ambiguities due to variable
contextual usage of the disease name mentions in clinical texts. In
particular, clinical trial texts have unique complexities compared
to patient-focused clinical reports or information-rich biomedical
research articles, as they typically define drug testing eligibility requirements
for patient cohorts via compound contextual and logical
relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel disease NER model
for clinical trial texts by using deep contextual embeddings with
relevant domain-specific features, word embeddings, and character
embeddings in a bidirectional long short-term memory networkconditional
random field (BiLSTM-CRF) framework. Experiments
and analyses on a clinical trial dataset and the benchmark NCBI
scientific article dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
model.
