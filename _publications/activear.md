<b>Abstract:</b>

Activity recognition in smart environment has been
investigated rigorously in recent years. Researchers are enhancing
the underlying activity discovery and recognition process by
adding various dimensions and functionalities. But one significant
barrier still persists which is collecting the ground truth
information. Ground truth is very important to initialize a
supervised learning of activities. Due to a large variety in number
of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), acknowledging them in a
supervised way is a non-trivial research problem. Most of the
previous researches have referenced a subset of ADLs and to
initialize their model, they acquire a vast amount of informative
labeled training data. On the other hand to collect ground truth
and differentiate ADLs, human intervention is indispensable. As
a result it takes an immense effort and raises privacy concerns
to collect a reasonable amount of labeled data. In this paper, we
propose to use active learning to alleviate the labeling effort and
ground truth data collection in activity recognition pipeline. We
investigate and analyze different active learning strategies to scale
activity recognition and propose a dynamic k-means clustering
based active learning approach. Experimental results on real data
traces from a retirement community-(IRB #HP-00064387) help
validate the early promise of our approach.
