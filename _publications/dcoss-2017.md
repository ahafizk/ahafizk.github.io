<b>Abstract:</b>

The new era of consumer devices ranging from
smartphones, smartwatches, and smart jewelries augmented with
our everyday activities and lifestyle help postulate human behavior,
activity, gesture, social interaction, and gaming experience.
Intelligently tasking and sharing the sensing, processing, storing,
and computing tasks among those emerging consumer-friendly
commodity devices based on their proximities, advocate the
development of resource-aware collaborative and opportunistic
smart living applications. Motivated by this emerging subsets of
phenomenal applications, we first propose a finite-state machine
(FSM) based human activity recognition framework which opportunistically
exploits the relevant data sources from multiple
heterogeneous devices to help infer a variety of user contexts.
We depict a lightweight maximum entropy based classifier
and exploit the a-priori conditional dependences among the
feature sets to opportunistically select the right set of sensors
with the most appropriate devices. Experimental results on
real data traces demonstrate that our proposed Collaborative
Opportunistic Activity Recognition, COAR framework helps infer
the activities of daily living with â‰ˆ 90% accuracy.
