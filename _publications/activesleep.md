<b>Abstract:</b>

Sleep is the most important aspect of healthy and active living. The right amount of sleep at the right time
helps an individual to protect his or her physical, mental, and cognitive health and maintain his or her quality
of life. The most durative of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL), sleep has a major synergic influence on a
personâ€™s fuctional, behavioral, and cognitive health. A deep understanding of sleep behavior and its relationship
with its physiological signals, and contexts (such as eye or body movements), is necessary to design and
develop a robust intelligent sleep monitoring system. In this article, we propose an intelligent algorithm to
detect the microscopic states of sleep that fundamentally constitute the components of good and bad sleeping
behaviors and thus help shape the formative assessment of sleep quality. Our initial analysis includes
the investigation of several classification techniques to identify and correlate the relationship of microscopic
sleep states with overall sleep behavior. Subsequently, we also propose an online algorithm based on change
point detection to process and classify the microscopic sleep states. We also develop a lightweight version
of the proposed algorithm for real-time sleep monitoring, recognition, and assessment at scale. For a larger
deployment of our proposed model across a community of individuals, we propose an active-learning-based
methodology to reduce the effort of ground-truth data collection and labeling. Finally, we evaluate the performance
of our proposed algorithms on real data traces and demonstrate the efficacy of our models for detecting
and assessing the fine-grained sleep states beyond an individual.
