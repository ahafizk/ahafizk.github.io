<b>Abstract:</b>

Activity recognition has applications in a variety
of human-in-the-loop settings such as smart home
health monitoring, green building energy and occupancy
management, intelligent transportation, and participatory
sensing. While fine-grained activity recognition systems and
approaches help enable a multitude of novel applications,
discovering them with non-intrusive ambient sensor systems
pose challenging design, as well as data processing, mining,
and activity recognition issues. In this paper, we develop
a low-cost heterogeneous Radar based Activity Monitoring
(RAM) system for recognizing fine-grained activities. We exploit
the feasibility of using an array of heterogeneous microdoppler
radars to recognize low-level activities. We prototype
a short-range and a long-range radar system and evaluate
the feasibility of using the system for fine-grained activity
recognition. In our evaluation, using real data traces, we show
that our system can detect fine-grained user activities with
92.84% accuracy.
