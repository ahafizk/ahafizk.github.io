<b>Abstract:</b>

Predicting the occupancy related information in an
environment has been investigated to satisfy the myriad requirements
of various evolving pervasive, ubiquitous, opportunistic and
participatory sensing applications. Infrastructure and ambient
sensors based techniques have been leveraged largely to determine
the occupancy of an environment incurring a significant
deployment and retrofitting costs. In this paper, we advocate
an infrastructure-less zero-configuration multimodal smartphone
sensor-based techniques to detect fine-grained occupancy information.
We propose to exploit opportunistically smartphonesâ€™
acoustic sensors in presence of human conversation and motion
sensors in absence of any conversational data. We develop
a novel speaker estimation algorithm based on unsupervised
clustering of overlapped and non-overlapped conversational data
to determine the number of occupants in a crowded environment.
We also design a hybrid approach combining acoustic sensing
opportunistically with locomotive model to further improve the
occupancy detection accuracy. We evaluate our algorithms in
different contexts; conversational, silence and mixed in presence
of 10 domestic users. Our experimental results on real-life data
traces collected from 10 occupants in natural setting show that
using this hybrid approach we can achieve approximately 0.76
error count distance for occupancy detection accuracy on average.
