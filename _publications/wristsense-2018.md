<b>Abstract:</b>

Gunshot detection traditionally has been a task
performed with acoustic signal processing. While this type of
detection can give cities, civil services and training institutes a
method to identify specific locations of gunshots, the nature of
acoustic detection may not provide the fine-grained detection
accuracy and sufficient metrics for performance assessment. If
however you examine a different signature of a gunshot, the
recoil, detection of the same event with accelerometers can
provide you with persona and firearm model level detection
abilities. The functionality of accelerometer sensors in wrist worn
devices have increased significantly in recent time. From fitness
trackers to smart watches, accelerometers have been put to use
in various activity recognition and detection applications. In this
paper, we design an approach that is able to account for the
variations in firearm generated recoil, as recorded by a wrist
worn accelerometer, and helps categorize the impulse forces. Our
experiments show that not only can wrist worn accelerometers
detect the differences in handgun rifle and shotgun gunshots, but
the individual models of firearms can be distinguished from each
other. The application of this framework could be extended in the
future to include real time detection embedded in smart devices
to assist in firearms training and also help in crime detection
and prosecution.
