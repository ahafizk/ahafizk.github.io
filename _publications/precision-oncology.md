<b>Abstract:</b>

This paper presents an ontology-driven treat-ment  article  retrieval  system  developed  andexperimented   using   the   data   and   groundtruths provided by the TREC 2017 precisionmedicine  track.   The  key  aspects  of  our  sys-tem  include:  meaningful  integration  of  vari-ous disease, gene, and drug name ontologies,training of a novel perceptron model for articlerelevance labeling, a ranking module that con-siders  additional  factors  such  as  journal  im-pact and article publication year, and compre-hensive  query  matching  rules.   Experimentalresults demonstrate that our proposed systemconsiderably  outperforms  the  results  of  thebest  participating  system  of  the  TREC  2017precision medicine challenge.
