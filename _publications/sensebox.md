<b>Abstract:</b>

Smart home technologies are getting acclaimed
for providing a wide variety of functionalities- security, appliance control, HVAC control and remote
monitoring. Installation cost and interoperability issues
have restricted the adaptability of these technologies. In
this demo paper, we demonstrate the design of an interoperable
prototype of our smart home system, SenseBox
using low-cost embedded device as part of an NSF I-Corps
project. We integrated an off-the-shelf commercially available
inexpensive ($12) hardware (PogoPlug). We paired
commercially available PIR sensors, door sensors and
moisture sensors with our smart home system prototype to
monitor human activities. We deployed our prototype and
collected real-time activity data traces from a retirement
community center. We articulated the SenseBox development,
integration and testing challenges and insights along
with real deployment experience.
