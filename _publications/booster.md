<b>Abstract:</b>
Biomedical Entity Recognition tasks have gained
significant importance in the clinical research domain. There
has been a lot of prior work on improving entity recognition
of biomedical concepts from using rule-based to more contextdependent
deep learning-based approaches. However, due to its
high domain dependency and distinctive vocabularies, appropriate
utilization of contextual knowledge becomes a challenge even
for context dependent deep models. To this end, we propose
a novel performance-boosting improvement module “BoostER”
that can be applied to any existing entity recognition system to
boost its performance in terms of precision and F1 scores. The
proposed module has been developed on top of a pre-trained
BERT model and fine-tuned to give more weights to contextual
learning compared to word-specific information. We tested our
system with Chemical and Disease Entity Recognition tasks using
the BioCreative CDR dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness
compared to existing state-of-the-art models.
