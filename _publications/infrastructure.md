<b>Abstract:</b>

Accurate estimation of localized occupancy related informa-
tion in real time enables a broad range of intelligent smart
environment applications. A large number of studies us-
ing heterogeneous sensor arrays reflect the myriad require-
ments of various emerging pervasive, ubiquitous and partic-
ipatory sensing applications. In this paper, we introduce a
zero-configuration and infrastructure-less smartphone based
location specific occupancy estimation model. In our pro-
posed model we combine acoustic (microphone), locomotive
(accelerometer) and location (magnetometer) specific sensor
of smartphone to derive fine-grained semantic location spe-
cific occupancy information at zone/room level granularity.
We opportunistically exploit smartphone’s acoustic sensors
in a conversing environment and motion sensors in absence
of any conversational data. We demonstrate a novel speaker
estimation algorithm based on unsupervised clustering of
overlapped and non-overlapped conversational data and a
change point detection algorithm for locomotive motion of
the users to infer the occupancy. We augment our occupancy
detection model with a fingerprinting based methodology us-
ing smartphone’s magnetometer sensor to accurately assim-
ilate location information of any gathering. We postulate a
novel crowdsourcing-based approach to annotate the seman-
tic location of the occupancy. We evaluate our algorithms
in different contexts; conversational, silence and mixed in
presence of 10 domestic users. Our experimental results on
real-life data traces in natural settings show that using this
hybrid approach, we can achieve approximately 0.76 error
count distance for occupancy detection accuracy on aver-
age.
